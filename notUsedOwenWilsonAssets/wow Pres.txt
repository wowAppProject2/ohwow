Hey everyone
My partner is Joe and our app is named Oh Wow

choose a Owen Wilson movie from the drop down
generate a random Wow clip
and info about it. 

We needed to pull from 2 APIs to make this work. 
1st MovieDB
2nd Owen Wilson Wow Api


OVERVIEW = Describe site top to bottom

//CLICK A MOVIE
Zoolander



---JOE---

Describe the wow video card and the replay button
Describe the poster card and the add to watch list button
Ask Nick to open the list



NICK -- WIN

We did paried programming the whole time. 
Paired programming made a lot more sense on a large project

We hit every stech goal and more
Original goal was to populate a random wow from a movie of choice with a working video clip which is a element we havent 
worked with before

Now we have a poster, description, rating, replay button, a scrolling watch list where items 
can be added or remove, notifications if the addition or removal was successful, and even this thing up here (click wowFace)

JOE -- CHALLENGES


Finding a working api with documentation we are comfortable with
We went into the project backwards where we had an idea for an app first then went looking for the right APIs
